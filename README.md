# arduino-SustainableFlightPath
The goal of this project is to suggest alternative navigation paths to aircraft, to fly efficiently; reduce emissions, and lower operational costs.

## This project is archived due to aircraft routes not being published online. The project continues under a different repository with another routing strategy.
